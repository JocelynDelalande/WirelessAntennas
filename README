Wireless Antennas QGIS plugin
=============================
This is an attempt to make a simple QGIS plugin allowing to get an idea of the
network coverage of a set of wireless antennas.

Well, it's very basic at the moment, but...
It (should) work as follows :
 - make a points layer describing your antenas network, with their
 characteristics (type, gain).
 - Select your layer in the layers pane
 - Run the plugin (press F6)
 - It draws a raster layer of wireless coverage.
